# hello-github

This is a text file.  It contains text, which is made up of letters selected from a 26-character alphabet.  Each letter is represented by one of two glyphs, either an uppercase or a lowercase version.  These letters are clustered into groups of words, with each word matching a verbal equivalent, which in turn signifies a concept, either concrete or abstract.  Individual words are separated by spaces, which is just blank space with no glyph and no meaning beyond improving readability.

If this were not a text file, you would see gibberish.  Each byte in the file would be shown as a glyph who's id matches the ascii value of the byte, producing a string of letters, numbers, and symbols that are not meant to be read by a human.  It is critically important that this gibberish is never read aloud by a human, as doing so can confuse other humans at best, and at worst it can summon entities that would normally never be able to enter or remain on this plane of existence.

This line was added from a branch created from a command line.  If all goes well then it will be pushed up properly.
